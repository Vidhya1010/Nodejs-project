# Nodejs-project
The above project is a blog analytics and search tool developed using Express.js, Axios, and Lodash. It serves as a web application that allows users to fetch and analyze data from a third-party blog API while also providing search functionality for blog posts. Here's a short description of the key features:

Data Retrieval: The application fetches data from a third-party blog API using a GET request with an admin secret for authentication.

Data Analysis: After retrieving data, the application uses Lodash to perform various analytics tasks, including calculating the total number of blogs, finding the blog with the longest title, determining the number of blogs with "privacy" in the title, and creating an array of unique blog titles.

Blog Search: The application provides a search endpoint that allows users to search for blog posts by title. It performs a case-insensitive search and returns matching blog posts.

Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling is implemented to handle potential issues during data retrieval, analysis, and search processes. It includes custom error messages and status codes.

API Integration: The application demonstrates the integration of external APIs (third-party blog API) using Axios to fetch data.

Overall, this project serves as a tool for analyzing and searching blogs, making it valuable for individuals or organizations looking to gain insights from blog data or enable users to search for relevant content.
